# NLP Projects

A curated collection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects implemented in Python. These projects encompass a range of core NLP tasks—from text preprocessing and feature extraction to advanced models like sentiment analysis, summarization, and conversation agents.

## 🧠 Project Showcase

Each project folder contains complete code, documentation, and sample datasets. Highlighted projects include:

- Text classification with TF-IDF and Naive Bayes  
- Sentiment analysis using LSTM and Transformer models  
- Text summarization (both extractive and abstractive)  
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) pipelines  
- Chatbot/Conversational AI demos  

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+  
- pip (Python package installer)  
- Virtual environment (recommended via `venv` or `conda`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imranashrafai/NLP-Projects.git
   cd NLP-Projects
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## 🔍 Usage

Each project directory contains its own `README.md` with setup steps:

- Navigate into a specific project folder, e.g., `sentiment_analysis/`
- Review the inside documentation  
- Run the main notebook or script, e.g.:  
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook sentiment_analysis.ipynb
  ```

## 📚 NLP Workflow

1. **Data Preparation** – tokenize, clean, and normalize text  
2. **Feature Engineering** – create TF-IDF, embeddings, or sequence data  
3. **Model Training** – apply ML (e.g., Naive Bayes) or DL (e.g., LSTM/Transformer)  
4. **Evaluation** – measure accuracy, F1-score, ROUGE, etc.  
5. **Visualization** – present results with plots or TensorBoard  
6. **Deployment/Demo** – interactive notebooks or simple script-based demos
